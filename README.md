# MovieWebBigData
Handling and organizing the dataset of a movie webpage for Files Structures and DataBases course.
This was programmed in SQL in a group project with Pablo Alba Martinez.

*Explanation*

We were given 3 tables (movies, users and events) and had to reorganize them so you could access different information efficiently.
For this task we had to create all the new tables, find out how to correctly insert the data, and then develop some additional query.
This is just an upload of my first time programming in SQL, there is very little commentary/explanation, it is just to showcase it.
Ask me for any question about how/why we did the code. Enjoy!
